    <p>I was born and raised in Phoenix but have been living in a small
    mountain town in Idaho for the past 6 years. My wife, Jess, is a nurse and we have an 11-month old daughter named Sloane. We also have a 13-year old husky mix named Lucy. We're back in Phoenix for a few months so my parents can help with childcare while I'm studying web development and my wife works a travel nurse assignment.</p>
